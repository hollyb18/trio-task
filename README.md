# Trio-task

## What was the challenge?
- To create two containers, one flask-app (python) and one sql database, and connect the two via a network in order for them to be able to interact with each other via Docker. Any sensitive information must be kept secret.

## How I expected the challenge to go.
- I originally thought that the challenge would take me all day, as I had had the least amount of direct experience with SQL containers. These were always the last tasks at the end of the day, and I did not manage to reach them, so I only had the demos to go by. However, I felt a lot more confident in focussing on the correct resources to teach myself what I needed to do to replicate the code in the task. I anticipated struggling to connect all the dots, but I surprised myself and seemed to do everything with comparative ease.

## What went well?
- I was able to remember a lot of the code from muscle memory - for example, the Dockerfile for the flask app was written without cross-referencing from elsewhere. I also understood each part of the build and run commands as I used them more and more, and started to have to write my own examples. I could see where different pieces of information linked up, such as the location of the CreateTable.sql file within the SQL Dockerfile and then consequently in the interactive shell. I left the challenge feeling far more secure in my knowledge of Docker than before.

## What didn't go as planned?
- I may need to pull the repo again and add another component to the RUN command in the flask-app Dockerfile. I was under the impression that the software ran okay without it, but now I am uncertain as to whether I have successfully completed the task and ran the application or not. I am not sure whether I properly reviewed my submission and may have misunderstood whether it was completed or not.

## Possible improvements for future challenges.
- Try not to get sidetracked with where other people are at! I think I may have offered to collaborate/help to early, and misunderstood the finishing point as a consequence. However, it is also my responsibility to be confident of what the finishing point is myself, so I know what I am aiming for.
